First, second and
third normalization forms have proven to be very useful when working with a lot
of data. They minimize repetition, increase efficiency and improves data by
structuring tables to ensure columns depend solely on the primary key. It also
increases data integrity meaning making sure data is accurate, searching for
already organized data becomes much easier. Storage space can be saved as well.

However, these
normalizations also have disadvantages as well. High normalization can lead to
complex queries, slow performance due to numerous operations and in some
rare cases, excessive table fragmentation.
